	This command:
		opens your tutorial.mallet file
		trains MALLET to find 20 topics
		outputs every word in your corpus of materials and the topic it belongs to into a compressed file 
		outputs a text document showing you what the top key words are for each topic (tutorial_keys.txt)
		and outputs a text file indicating the breakdown, by percentage, of each topic within each original text file you imported (tutorial_composition.txt). (To see the full range of possible parameters that you may wish to tweak, type bin\mallet train-topics â€“help at the prompt.)
